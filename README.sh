This is a bunch of bad python that controls my pool pump via an arduino hacked onto a consumer remote controlled mains plug.

It has three main functions:
1) It polls the local weather station to get the current wind speed, and turns on when the wind is high (so that leaves landing in the pool get skimmed out)
2) It runs a few hours a day on a schedule
3) It turns on when request via a web interface- I have this hooked up to android and tasker so I get voice control
